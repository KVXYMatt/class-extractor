# class-extractor README

Extracts CSS classes from a selection of markup and formats it into a useable list to paste into your CSS/LESS/SASS/whatever.

## Requirements

## Future Plans

- Proper unit testing & code restructure to allow proper unit testing
- Indentation in class structure to match existing markup. Makes BEM work a little better
